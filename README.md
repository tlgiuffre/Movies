Group 2: Jacob, Sacha, Sofia, Tristan - Big Data Challenge

# Question: 
Can we use user data from Netflix to generate movie reccomendations, and can we then use the data to see trends in content consumed at differnt times of the year. 

# Description:

Streaming services like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, etc. offer users content recommendations based on previous watches and trending films/shows. Our group has set out to create our own Reccomendation system based on user preferences and browsing history using machine learning and the MovieLens dataset. This dataset consists of 105339 ratings applied over 10329 movies. Our reccomendation system will utilize this dataset and user data to provide reccomendatiosn for future content consumption.
