# Each group hands in 1) their question and a concise context description (1/2-1 page), 2) an outline of the workflow of your project (1/2 page) and 3) a summary of the results. This has to be stored on the GitHub wiki page of your Big Data Challenge repository.

# Question: 
Can we use user data (similiar to what is done by Subscription Streaming Entertainment Services(i.e. Neftlix, Hulu, Amazon Prime)) to generate movie reccomendations, and can we then use the data to see trends in content consumed at different times throughout the year (i.e. do we see more Horror movies consumed in October?). 

# Description:

Recommendation systems using Machine Learning have many applications across manyvarying industries.  Subscription Streaming Entertainment Services like Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, etc. offer users content recommendations based on previous watches and trending films/shows. Our group has set out to create our own reccomendation system based on user preferences and browsing history using machine learning and the MovieLens dataset. This dataset consists of 105339 ratings applied over 10329 movies. Our reccomendation system will utilize this dataset and user data to provide individualized reccomendations for future content consumption. 

# Outline/Workflow:
We decided to take on this project for a number of reasons; namely, because we found a lot of resources related to the topic online and are all implictly involved in these types of systems in our own lives (i.e. we all use a variation of these Subscription Streaming Entertainment Services).

Our approach was to first do some brief googling to hone into our exact topic. Next we had to find datasets (wouldn't be much of a data challenge w/out data...)this provided the foundation to begin working in R.
